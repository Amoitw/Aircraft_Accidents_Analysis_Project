# Aircraft Accidents Data Analysis

This project explores patterns in aviation accidents using a publicly available dataset. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations, the goal is to uncover insights that can inform aviation safety practices, policy improvements, and risk reduction strategies.

## Project Structure

- `Data/` – Folder containing Raw dataset containing accident records
- `Aircraft_Accidents_Analysis.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `Visualization/` – Folder containing generated graphs and visualizations
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation
- `Aircraft_Accidents_Analysis_Dashbord.twbx` - Tableau dashboard
- `Aircraft Accidents Analysis Presenation.ppt` - Powerpoint presentation

## Key Questions Explored

- What is the distribution of fatal vs non-fatal accidents?
- Which years experienced the highest accident rates?
- What phases of flight are most prone to accidents?
- Which aircraft makes and models are most frequently involved in fatal accidents?
- How have accident trends evolved over time?

## Highlights from the Analysis

- **Fatal vs Non-Fatal:** A majority of reported accidents were non-fatal, though fatal incidents represent significant safety risks.
- **Flight Phase Risk:** Most accidents occurred during critical flight phases such as **landing**, **takeoff**, and **approach**.
- **Aircraft Make Insight:** Certain aircraft types had notably higher counts of fatal injuries.
- **Time Trends:** Accident frequencies varied significantly by year, suggesting impacts from regulatory or operational changes.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data wrangling and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Static data visualization
- **Plotly** – Interactive plots and charts
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Exploratory programming and documentation
- **Tableau Dashboard** - Interactive and story telling plots and charts

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were proposed:
- Enhance **pilot training** for high-risk flight phases
- Improve **weather integration** in flight planning tools
- Prioritize **inspections** for aircraft with higher fatality histories
- Encourage industry-wide adoption of **Safety Management Systems (SMS)**
