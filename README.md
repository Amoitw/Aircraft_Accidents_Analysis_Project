 Project Goal
Tasked with analyzing aircraft accident data to:

Determine which aircraft pose the lowest risk.

Provide three actionable business recommendations based on your findings.

Dataset Overview
The dataset covers civil aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It likely includes:

Dates, locations, and descriptions of incidents

Aircraft types and operators

Causes of accidents

Fatalities/injuries

 Approach
1. Data Cleaning
Remove duplicates

Handle missing values (e.g., fill, drop, flag)

Standardize column names and types (e.g., dates, categories)

2. Data Exploration
Frequency of incidents over time

Most and least risky aircraft models

Common causes of accidents

Trends by operator, region, or aircraft type

3. Risk Analysis
Calculate accident rates per aircraft model (e.g., number of accidents / number of years or flights if available)

Analyze severity (fatal vs. non-fatal)

Rank aircraft from least to most risky

4. Recommendations
Based on your analysis, suggest:

Which aircraft models are safest

What risks the company should be aware of

How to mitigate those risks when operating certain aircraft

5. Visualization
Use charts (bar, line, pie, heatmaps) to support your analysis

Consider creating a basic dashboard (optional, for extra value)
